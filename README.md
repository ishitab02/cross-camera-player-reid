# cross-camera-player-reid

This project focuses on mapping players consistently across two different camera feeds of the same sports gameplayâ€”broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4. The goal is to assign consistent player IDs across both views using a provided object detection model and any visual, spatial, or temporal cues.
